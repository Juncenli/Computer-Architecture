# Part A


## Question:

You may have to adjust the number of LOOPS specified in the source code to get a reasonable Dhrystone number. Try different numbers of iterations until you get a reasonable result. 

## Answer:

I use X86-64 architecture to evaluate the CPU performance according to changes in the LOOP number. In the beginning, the LOOP = 50000000, then I will change LOOP from 50000000 to 200000000. I will run 12 times.

The CPU information is as follows:

Dhrystone Number Table

|Loop       |The average Dhrystone number runs three times|
|-----      |--------     |
|50000000   |  9444444    |
|100000000  |  9696969    |
|150000000  |  10029761   |
|200000000  |  9682539    |


So, the reasonable Dhrystone numbe equals (9444444 + 9696969 + 10029761 + 9682539) / 4 = 9,713,428




## Question:

Also, make multiple runs of Dhrystone to guarantee you have factored out any sampling or cold-start effects. Make sure to discussion this issue in your paper and report on the error in your measurements.

## Answer:

Sampling and cold-start effects can impact the results of the Dhrystone benchmark and introduce error in the measurements because they can cause variations in the performance of the system being tested.

In terms of sampling effects, different input data can result in variations in the performance of the system. For example, if the benchmark is run with a dataset that is particularly large or complex, the results may be different than if the benchmark is run with a smaller or simpler dataset. These variations in the input data can affect the performance of the system and lead to errors in the measurements.

Cold-start effects can also impact the results of the benchmark because the initial state of the system can affect its performance. For example, when the system is first powered on, it may not be fully initialized, and its performance may be affected. This can lead to variations in the results if the benchmark is run immediately after the system is powered on, versus if it is run after the system has been running for a period of time. These variations can affect the accuracy of the measurements and introduce error.

By taking into account the effects of sampling and cold-start, it is possible to run the benchmark multiple times with different input data and allow the system to warm up before each run. These steps can help to reduce the impact of these effects on the results and improve the accuracy of the measurements.


## Question:

Run Dhrystone compiled with and without optimization (find out how to use the compiler switches, the man gcc pages should help). Explain the results you are getting. How does optimization affect the results obtained on the different architectures and why? 


## Answer:

|Optimization       |The average Dhrystone number runs three times|
|-----              |--------     |
|No  Optimization   |  9444444    |
|-O1                |  41666666   |
|-O2                |  41666666   |
|-O3                |  50000000   |

As we use -OX (from 1 to 3), the performance is improving. 

When using the GCC -O switch, where X is a value between 1 and 3, the compiler is applying different levels of optimization to the code. The higher the value of X, the more aggressive the optimizations applied.

When using the -O switch, the compiler will perform a series of transformations on the source code to make it more efficient. These optimizations can include things like removing unnecessary instructions, reducing the number of memory accesses, and reordering instructions to improve the performance of the CPU.

At -O1, the compiler performs basic optimizations that improve the performance of the code without sacrificing the readability of the code.

At -O2, the compiler performs more aggressive optimization that can improve the performance of the code, but it may make the code harder to understand.

At -O3, the compiler performs even more aggressive optimization that can improve the performance of the code, but it may make the code harder to understand.

When applied to the Dhrystone benchmark, these optimizations can increase the Dhrystone number. This is because the compiler is making the code more efficient, which results in better performance when the benchmark is run. However, the increase in Dhrystone number will depend on how well the compiler optimizes the code and how much the code can benefit from the optimization.

It's worth noting that the GCC -O switch is not the only way to improve performance, the use of other techniques such as parallelization, vectorization, and the use of specific libraries for certain operations can also help to improve performance.

Run Dhrystone compiled without optimization

![x86-64 no optimization](screenshots/X86-64.jpg)

### For the X86-64, answer the following questions:


1) What are the three most frequently executed functions?

    Answer: Func1, Proc7 and Proc8.

2) What percentage of the entire execution time do they each consume? 

    Answer: 36.85


3) How does optimization change this percentage and why?

    Answer: I optimize from O1 to O3.

![x86-64 O2 optimization](screenshots/X86-64-O2.jpg)

![x86-64 O3 optimization](screenshots/X86-64-O3.jpg)

|Optimization       | Percentage  |
|-----              |--------     |
|No  Optimization   |  36.85    |
|-O1                |  24.25   |
|-O2                |  22.2   |
|-O3                |  7.85   |


When I use a higher level of optimization with GCC, the compiler uses more sophisticated algorithms to optimize the code. These algorithms can improve the performance of the code by reducing the number of instructions executed, increasing the use of the CPU's cache, and improving the use of the CPU's execution units. As a result, the code runs faster, and the percentage of the entire execution time decreases.

### For the ARM, answer the following questions:


1) What are the three most frequently executed functions?

    Answer: Func1, Proc7 and Proc1.

2) What percentage of the entire execution time do they each consume? 

    Answer: 31.49


3) How does optimization change this percentage and why?

    Answer: I optimize from O1 to O3.

![ARM O1 optimization](screenshots/ARM-O1.jpg)

![ARM O2 optimization](screenshots/ARM-O2.jpg)

![ARM O3 optimization](screenshots/ARM-O3.jpg)

|Optimization       | Percentage  |
|-----              |--------     |
|No  Optimization   |  31.49      |
|-O1                |  33.92      |
|-O2                |  59.29       |
|-O3                |  100       |



It is not typical for the percentage of the entire execution time to increase when using a higher level of optimization with GCC for ARM. However, it is possible that the specific code while compiling, or the specific version of GCC that I am using, may have a bug that causes the higher level of optimization to produce less efficient code. It could also be that the code was initially not written in a way that benefits from the advanced optimization and it's causing the execution time to increase. Another reason could be that higher levels of optimization may increase the size of the binary, which in turn can cause an increase in execution time due to cache misses.

|Optimization       |  MFLOPS     |
|-----              |--------     |
|No  Optimization   |  566.666667 |
|-O1                |1910.476190  |

|-O3                |2156.989247  |


The available levels of optimization are denoted by the parameters -O1, -O2, and -O3. The levels of optimization are -O1 (lowest) and -O3 (highest). The amount of optimization done to the code varies between these levels, with -O3 applying the most aggressive optimization.

In general, you can anticipate more performance improvements the higher the optimization level. It's important to keep in mind, though, that -O3 occasionally makes the code less reliable or slower to execute.

Loop unrolling is one of the key performance-enhancing optimizations the compiler will carry out at the -O3 level. This is due to the fact that it minimizes the number of times the loop condition must be verified and it also has the potential to execute fewer instructions.

Other optimizations that are used at the -O3 level include Inlining of tiny functions, Profile-guided Optimization, and Inter-procedural optimization (IPO).

In conclusion, a Linpack benchmark application can run significantly faster on an x86 Linux system when GCC's -O3 option is used. To make sure that performance enhancements do not compromise stability or performance, it is crucial to evaluate the application after compilation.

# Part C

I will use Phoronix Test Suite (PTS) to benchmark my system.

[Source](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/) 

## Question:

Discuss what the benchmark is designed to measure and discuss the benchmarking results you obtain on that system.

## Answer:

An open-source benchmarking tool called the Phoronix Test Suite (PTS) enables you to evaluate the efficiency of a variety of hardware and software parts on a system. It has many built-in test profiles that may be used to gauge how well a system's graphics, memory, storage, and other subsystems operate.

PTS is made to assess how well a system performs under various workloads, including CPU, memory, storage, and graphics. Several benchmarking tools are included, including C-Ray, OpenSSL, and Sysbench. Additionally, it enables testing customization and allows for results comparison with other systems or setups.

For reliable results when benchmarking with PTS, it's critical to conduct the test on the same machine, with the same configuration, and using the same test profile. Each test profile's specific performance characteristics, such as CPU clock speed, memory bandwidth, and disk I/O, will be provided in the benchmark results. The findings are displayed graphically, making it simple to compare the effectiveness of various systems or combinations.

The individual system being tested, the compiler being used, and the test profile can all affect the benchmark results, it's crucial to keep in mind. To fully appreciate a system's performance, it is therefore advised to utilize the benchmark in conjunction with other performance measures. It's also crucial to remember that the benchmark findings should be used with caution and should be used as a guide rather than an absolute figure.


## Question:

Can you suggest a system where it might run more efficiently? Make sure to justify your answer.

## Answer:

The workloads used in the benchmark will be processed more effectively by a system with a high-performance CPU, leading to higher performance measurements. Large amounts of memory are also advantageous because they can lower the benchmark's need for disk I/O, which raises memory bandwidth scores.

Additionally, selecting a system with a quick storage subsystem, like an NVMe SSD, would be advantageous if the benchmark contains any tests that primarily rely on disk I/O, like storage benchmarks.

In order to achieve the best performance possible, it would also be advantageous if the system was running a recent version of the operating system. It is also advised to have the most recent updates and drivers.

In conclusion, a system running a recent version of the operating system, a high-performance CPU, a lot of RAM, and a quick storage subsystem, would be expected to perform well with the Phoronix Test Suite.
